# 3fs-challenge

## Instructions

1. Build a simple object storage application using React with following requirements:

create bucket with name and location
list all buckets
delete a single bucket
upload an object to a bucket
list all objects in a bucket
delete an object

2. Use wireframes available at `https://challenge.3fs.si/storage/docs/wireframes.pdf` for the application’s design and UX.

3. API specification is available at `https://challenge.3fs.si/storage/docs`.

4. Write all needed tests.

5. Use module bundler and git.

6. Use docker and docker compose for bonus points.

7. Other:

a git repository with full commit history is expected to be part of the delivered solution
if needed, provide additional installation instructions, but there shouldn’t be much more than running a simple command to set everything up
use best practices all around. For Angular, good source of that would be `https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/style-guide.html`
use default Bootstrap UI elements, don’t focus too much on UI/UX
use `https://onetimesecret.com/secret/idpj2s01iqlzesj9gxtj6sct8l1q2mm` for the authorization token

Important: do not take this task lightly. You will be judged according to the quality, completion and perfection of the task.

# Docker-compose installation

Run `docker-compose up -d --build`. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`.

# Running locally
